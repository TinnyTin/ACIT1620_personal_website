        <p>
            My name is <strong>Martin Lee</strong> and I am from Vancouver. I have a slight hobby in gaming but most of my day is occupied by schoolwork or just everyday errands.
            My only background in computers is a completed Bachelor of Science (major in Computer Science) from UBC. Otherwise, I have <em>no relevant work experience.</em>
            
            Here are 3 courses I am currently taking at BCIT:
